    "\n",
    "The price airfare is a very interesting topic.  There are countless times in my life I decided to book travel only to look to see the cost of the flight was beyond my budget.  Predicting the cost of airfare is a significant undertaking that I suspect a lot of traveling individuals would be interested in.  Of course you know the price of the flight when you book it, but wouldn't it be cool and highly beneficial to know ahead of time what the cost of the flight will be at a specific date in the future?  If you did know that you may be inclined to continue procrastinating or in fact pull the trigger asap as you know you have found yourself a deal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project sets out to predict airfare pricing so that individuals are well equipped when searching for airfare and they will be empowered to make a decision quicker based on a comparison of a price quote they find online vs. what our models predict will be the airfare cost.\n",
